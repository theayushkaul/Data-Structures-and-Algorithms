Solve for recurrsion
Then solve using Memoization
then using tabulation 
then optimize for the space

Steps For Memoization:
a) Make a dp Array of size(n+1,-1): Understand what you are gonna store in a dp array: Most of the time it is the overlapping results that you need
    There is always a connection between i and dp[i]
b) pass and store the results in dp array
c)if(dp[n] != -1){
		return dp[n];
	}
    Add this code in the base cases to check if this result is already been calculated 

Steps For Tabulation:
for loop
dp array
